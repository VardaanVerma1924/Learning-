# Learning C

## 🛣️ C Programming Roadmap

## 📘 Phase 1: Basics of C

### ✅ Goals

* Understand syntax, structure, and simple logic.
* Be able to write and compile simple programs.

### 📚 Topics

* What is C? History and Features
* Structure of a C Program
* Data Types and Variables
* Input/Output (printf, scanf)
* Operators (Arithmetic, Relational, Logical)
* Control Flow (if, else, switch)
* Loops (for, while, do-while)

### 🛠️ Tools

* GCC or Clang compiler
* Code editor: VS Code, Code::Blocks, etc.

---

## 🚧 Phase 2: Intermediate Concepts

### ✅ Goals

* Write modular code with functions.
* Understand memory layout and scope.

### 📚 Topics

* Functions (Declaration, Definition, Call)
* Arrays (1D, 2D)
* Strings and String functions
* Pointers (Basics, Pointer Arithmetic)
* Scope and Storage Classes (auto, static, extern)

---

## 🧠 Phase 3: Advanced Topics

### ✅ Goals

* Handle complex logic and dynamic memory.
* Understand how C interacts with hardware.

### 📚 Topics

* Structures and Unions
* Dynamic Memory Allocation (`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`)
* File I/O (`fopen`, `fclose`, `fread`, `fwrite`, etc.)
* Command Line Arguments
* Preprocessor Directives (`#define`, `#include`, `#ifdef`)

---

## 🛡️ Phase 4: Mastery & Applications

### ✅ Goals

* Optimize and debug C code.
* Use C in real-world systems.

### 📚 Topics

* Recursion
* Bitwise Operators
* Makefiles & Linking
* Debugging with `gdb`
* C Libraries (standard and custom)
* Introduction to Embedded C
